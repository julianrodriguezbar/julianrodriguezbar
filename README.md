Hi stranger ðŸ‘‹. I am Julian David Rodriguez Barragan . I started my journey as a full stack developer on October 4th 2022. Previously, I had been working as a product manager 
in the start-up environment for 2.5 years. As a product manager I was in charge of backend and frontend developers , quality assurance analyst and product designers.
While working as a product manager I realized that what I enjoyed was to understand the code behind a feature, a screen , application etc rather than told the 
development team to build what I have thought with the users and designers.

Having said that, here I am starting a new career path as a full stack engineer ðŸŒ±.
